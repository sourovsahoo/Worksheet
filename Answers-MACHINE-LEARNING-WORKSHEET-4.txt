9.Let there are four positive Class A and six negative Class B.
Thus, P (+) = 4/10 and P (−) = 6/10.

The Entropy  =  −4/10 log2(4/10) − 6/10 log2(6/10) 

Gini Index   =  (4/10)^2 + (6/10)^2 =0.52

a)Random forest is a ensemble technique while decesion tree is not.
And we know ensemble works better.
b)Random forest uses the weak learner technique where many trees are trained to give a strong output.
Whereas decesion trees are just one tree model.
c)Decesion tree is prone to overfitting.

11.
Scaling is done to get all the numerical values to a common unit.two techniques:-
a)StandardScaler-converts the data to gaussian distribution where mean=0 and standard deviation=1
 
b)MinMaxScaler-converts the data inbetween 0 and 1,

No,accuracy is a good metric to measure the performance of the model when the data is inbalanced highly.
The model gets biased toward the class with higher frequency and the prediction hence gives higher accuracy,but its all biased results and we should'nt accept it.Again,
Acuuracy does not distinguish between the numbers of correctly classified points of different classes.

The F-score, also called the F1-score, is a measure of a model's performance on a dataset. 
The F-score is a way of combining the precision and recall of the model, and it is defined as the harmonic mean of the model's precision and recall.

F1=  2 / [ (1/prcesion) + (1/recall) ]

15.To center the data (make it have zero mean and unit standard error), We subtract the mean and then divide the result by the standard deviation in standard scaler.

                                                                                  x′=x−μσ
We convert the data in between 0 to 1 in minmaxscaler.

                                                   
We do this on the training set of data. But then we have to apply the same transformation to our testing set.
But we have to use the exact same two parameters μ and σ (values) that we used for centering the training set.

Hence,sklearn.StandardScaler.fit() just calculates the parameters (e.g. μ and σ in case of StandardScaler) and saves them as an internal object's state.

Afterwards,sklearn.StandardScaler.transform() method is called to apply the transformation to any particular dataframe.

fit_transform() joins above two steps and is used for the initial fitting of parameters on the training set x,
while also returning the transformed x′. 
Internally, the transformer object just calls first fit() and then transform() on the same data.
