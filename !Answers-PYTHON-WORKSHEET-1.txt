6.The finally keyword is used to execute code (used with exceptions - try.. catch statements) no matter if there is an exception or not.
7.The raise keyword is used to raise an exception.We can define what kind of error to raise, and the text to print to the user.
8.We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don't want to store the entire sequence in memory. Yield are used in Python generators. A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return.
