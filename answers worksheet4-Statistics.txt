Normal distribution is often called the bell curve because the graph of its probability density looks like a bell.
 It is also known as called Gaussian distribution.
This normal type of data distribution is rare in real world scenarios.
Modifying the Data into Normal / Gaussian format gives best results for model building in Machine Learning.

Missing data is handeled by 2 types of imputation technicques.

a)Manual-->imputing data into data set after getting the insight of the data.

b)automatic-->Imputer method library in python.G
enerally KNN alogorithm is used for this Automatic imputation technique.

My Reccomendation is option (a)
Because analyzing the data before imputation is a must process in model building.

A/B Testing is a tried-and-true method commonly performed using a traditional statistical inference approach grounded in a hypothesis test.
 EXAMPLE:-- t-test, z-score, chi-squared test). 
Here 2 tests are run in parallel: 
Treatment Group (Group A) - This group is exposed to the new web page, popup form, etc


13. Mean imputation of missing data is acceptable or not will be decided Only after analyzing the data.
When in real world dataset scenarios,Even if we replace the missing values with the mean we have to produce valid reasons of replacing like so.
